# Basic example B1
This example uses the same geometry and physics list as the Geant4 [basic/B1](https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/tree/master/examples/basic/B1) example. It is presented in two formats:
- As a Julia program `B1.jl`
- As a Jupyter notebook `B1.ipynb`

Refer to the [README](https://github.com/Geant4/geant4/blob/master/examples/basic/B1/README) for understanding what the example does.
